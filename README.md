# Email Plain Text and HTML Email using Django 1.11

A simple example of using text and html templates to send email using Django. The project is a simple intro and functionality is limited to viewing emails in the terminal window.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

`git clone repo`   
`cd episode-19-using-templates-for-sending-emails`  
`python3 -m venv _env`

For convenience make .manage.py executable. 
`chmod +x manage.py`
